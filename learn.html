			Hello! My name's right up there (^) if you wanted to wait and watch it. Thank you for taking the time to hear my story. Mine has been one of turmoil, but in those circumstances I've found solace in and a passion for design. It's in creating that I'm most emowered to communicate all the positive and negative experiences that influence the way I view the world, and in turn, the way I view art. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Even though I chose "Drive," my homepage animation, to headline my website because of that pull towards artistic expression, I'm definitely still a stats major at heart. As dissonant as STEM and art seem on paper, it's their balance that preserves my sanity when either one becomes overwhelming on its own. I see creating art as the synthesis of an indvidual's outlook on life, as well as everything they've experienced that shapes that outlook. For me, that means mathematics, communications, and technology. Among others, these practices inform the way I produce art; the completely unprecedented, "thenathaniellowe" way of design.
		</p>
		<p> 
			That balance between STEM and art often manifests in technical form. For example, I pick and choose moments in my work to create somewhere on a spectrum between formulaic and freely artistic depending on how I want to convey a particular message. But beyond technique, math and design also necessitate learning not focused on getting answers, but rather on finding them. Every field presents problems, but rarely in the same form twice. It's the calculated dpiligence required by math to solve problems you can't anticipate that translates to a fervor for design challenges. 
		</p>
		<p>
			That lesson applies to real life struggles, to questions you can't always solve. For me, it's namely been mental health. I have and/or continue to battle with a combination of bipolar, depression, and schizophrenia. It sucks. a lot. I was hospitalized, sent to the ER, or detained by police somewhere in the neighborhood of 15-18 times in one year. I never thought I'd get out of that wretched cycle because unlike my studies, there was no answer. There's no cure for being perpetually sad or seeing things that don't exist. But in evaluating those problems, I realize my outlook on life doesn't necessitate convenient circumstances. I don't approach design problems like they don't have solutions, so just because mental health doesn't have any (yet) doesn't mean I should change that. I have stared down every struggle in my life, believing that if I can't fix it now, I'll figure it out eventually.
		</p>
		<p> <!-- nth-child 5 -->
			"my outlook on life doesn't necessitate convenient circumstances"
		</p>
		<p>
			"if I can't fix it now, I'll figure it out eventually"
		</p>
		<p> <!-- nth-child 7 -->
			Unfortunately, that doesn't necessarily mean I will though. I might struggle with these illnesses forever, and that's more or less out of my control. And while the "solutions" haven't added up thus far, I'm continually putting the pieces of the larger proof of my improvement together. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Because what no one tells you about mental illness is that it isn't about exercising regularly, eating healthy, talking to your doctors, and regularly taking your medications. It's about doing any or all of those things in addition to whatever keeps you mentally devoted to solving a problem that might not have any answers. I wake up every morning acknowledging that regardless of how little of my daily struggle is in my hands, it's my choice to take the things that are and make them beautiful.
		</p>
		<p>
			One of those emblematic choices was solo travel. My first trip to New York changed my life. Aside from the tourist high, I felt invigorated knowing I had made the decision to be there. I felt emboldened that for the first time throughout my struggle with mental illness I had some control over where I end up in life. I can be where I want, doing what I want, focusing on dignifying my value as a human being. At the time, that meant for a couple of weeks, but then the mental switch flipped. I can affect my overall happiness: the places, people, and passions I want to pursue; not just my happiness until I get back on the plane.
		</p>	
		<p> <!-- nth-child 10 -->
			When I did pack up to go home, I also recognized that life isn't going to put itself on hold so I can catch my breath and then resume when I get over my problems. I'm going to get back home and struggle in many of the same ways I did when I left. New York won't solve any of those problems, and in fact, it will probably further complicate them. 
		</p>
		<p>
			But maybe getting back into academics, exercising my heart out, volunteering, working to keep myself active, applying to a school across the country, then moving across the country, and making life out of something I once deemed worthless is the full solution. Regardless of success or failure, I'm putting myself in the direct path of an invigorating life change. Don't get me wrong, I love the city, the school, the people, and would be be devastated to come up short. But at the end of it all, if I failed to make it to New York, I'm still miles ahead of where I was before I dreamed about it. Because at the end of it all, overcoming depression, and bipolar, and schizophrenia might not mean curing them, but rather leading a more fruitful and value-driven lifestyle than I ever could without them. 
		</p>	
		<p>
			With that, I actually have I have a few words to share with you. Please take what I say as from the heart. I built this with different visions for different audiences. If you haven't relaxed yet (i.e. seen my homepage video), I encourage you to do so first. Otherwise...
		</p>
		<p>
			...if you're a stranger to me, I welcome you now as a friend. Everything on this website is highly personal, but not exclusive. While the content itself may not be relatable, my hope is that they explore something about the world you live in or the people you know. Maybe someone you care about is struggling with mental health and you don't know how to help. Maybe your world is clouded with negativity that it's hard to see how anything could work out for good. Whatever your situation is, I hope my thoughts can uncover something you didn't you, or someone you care about is facing.
		</p>
		<p>
			...if you're a recruiter or a professional, my ultimate message to you is that my skills are a vehicle for conveying a much larger picture than what fits on a resume or portfolio. I have a passion for design with unmatched skills to back that up. I'm the most tenacious learner I have ever met, and I apply myself as hard as I can to every class, skill, or job I've ever invested in. However, vivacity for accomplishment only take an individual so far in life. In recognition of that, I use my expertise as a backdrop, never the main character, to convey my story.
		</p>
		<p> <!-- nth child 15 -->
			...if you're a friend or family member, here's a window into my life. This website is the evolution of my voice over this time. I'm well aware that I've changed dramatically since high school, and that the longer you've known me, sometimes the harder it is to accept that. Whether you're disappointed, confused, excited, or optimistic about those changes, my hope is that you would simply accept that this is me right now. Whatever image of me you were left with the last time we talked, I hope you'd be able to put those expectations aside long enough for me to share who I've become.
		</p>
		<p>
			...and if you're Nathaniel reflecting back on everything you've poured your time, money, heart, and soul into over the past few years, remember why you did that. Remember where you were when you started. Remember all the hours you devoted to monotonous coding because inside, the bipolar convinced you you were tumultuous. Remember all the days you forced yourself to draw and journal because inside, the depression convinced you your sad story had already been written. Remember all the all-nighters you pulled to get this done, not because you had deadlines, but because the schizo convinced you if you slept, you'd never wake up. Remember that while you were still writing this, you weren't sure if even you believed the words you were saying. Because the most important thing you can remember is that if you're still alive to read this, you've survived x amount of days, put up with y amount of pain, and learned z amount of lessons that put you in a better place than when you wrote this. You are stronger because of it, and if this man can make beautiful another day, then so can you.
		</p>
		<p>
			And with that said, I invite you to explore. Learn. Work. Draw. But most importantly, never forget to go home and Relax.
