			Hello! My name's right up there (^) if you didn't know, but I find it unlikely you logged on here without knowing that. Thank you for taking the time to hear my story and see everything I've worked on over the past year and a half. This time has been one of turmoil, but in that I've found solace in and a passion for design. It's in creating that I'm best able to communicate all the experiences, both positive and negative, that influence the way I view the world, and in turn, the way I view art. 
		</p>
		<p>
			"Drive," my homepage video, is by far the piece in my portfolio I'm most proud of. First and foremost, it captures the breadth of skills I've sharpened ever since coming to Berkeley, something I'm very proud of considering I never saw myself in a creative field coming into college. However, more importantly, it showcases the three major phases of my life: past, present, and future. 
		</p>
		<div class="parallax"><!--  nth-child(3) -->
		</div>
		<p>
			Past is a short bit on purpose. While I'm thankful for the priviledge of growing up where I did, it's burdened with a lot of loss and pain. Those memories, while sweet on their own, are often colored by what I'm going through now.
		</p>
		<p>
			And that's where present comes into play. As many of my close acquaintances know, I've had a lot of conflict with people in my past. But that is not a point of sympathy, and that's not why this website exists. It exists because those struggles drew me to expressive outlets: music, photography, design. I didn't appreciate summer art camp at the San Diego Zoo enough in elementary school. I didn't appreciate trumpet lessons enough in high school. I didn't appreciate digital art as a field enough, even after taking classes in college. I didn't even appreciate the power of expression on social media enough until quite recently when my friend convinced me to get one. Yet, all these things somehow laid the groundwork for what I invest the majority of my time in nowadays. I'm definitely still a stats major at heart, and as dissonant as STEM and art seem on paper, it's their balance that has preserved my sanity when either interest becomes overly stressful.
		</p>
		<div class="parallax"> <!-- nth-child(6) -->
		</div>
		<p>
			Exploring art has opened me towards being more adventurous in a variety of facets of my life. Art taught me to make mistakes. It taught me to be okay with sucking along the path towards success. Unlike math, being wrong in design isn't about answers, so much as it is about lessons. It's more conducive to asking "why" as opposed to "how,"" both of which are essential questions. Taking time away from school was taboo until art encouraged me to ask why. Why am I bound to a major (Business/Economics) I'm not super passionate about? Why would I continue to pursue it just to graduate in four years? Avid travelers are probably going to mock me, and even though it isn't the craziest decision in the world, going to New York alone opened my eyes. Solo travel was something I never would have considered without first challenging the way I dressed, the music I liked, etc. But then I asked why? Or more accurately, why not? Why not travel somewhere alone? In fact, why not live here long term? So yes, moving to New York right now is my focus: my Holy Grail. Everything I do is with that goal in mind. I feel emboldened that for the first time in my life I have some control over where I end up in life. I can affect my happiness: the places, people, and passions I want to pursue; not family, not friends, and not society.

			With that, I actually have I have a few words to share with those groups of people if they ever get the chance to see this. Please take what I say to you as from the heart. I built this with a different vision for each person. If you haven't relaxed yet (seen the video on my homepage), I encourage you to do so first. Otherwise...
		</p>
		<p>
			...if you're a stranger, again, I welcome you. Everything on this website is highly personal. Do not take that to mean I don't want you to explore the facets of my story. While the content itself may not be relatable, my hope is that that they explore something about the world you live in or the people you know. Maybe someone you care about is struggling with mental health and you don't know how to help. Maybe your world is clouded with negativity that it's hard to see how anything could work out for good. Whatever your situation is, I hope my thoughts can uncover something you didn't know someone else faces.

			...if you're a recruiter or a professional looking at this website as a final product, please understand that it was not initially designed for you. That being said, I'm glad you're here. No, this is not the most robust website on the internet by a long shot, nor did I intend for this to primarily be a demonstration of my abilities. However, I have a passion for design with the necessary skills to back that up. I'm the most tenacious learner I have ever met, and I apply myself as hard as I can to every class, skill, or job I've ever invested in.

			...if you're a friend or family member, here's a window into my life ever since I came to college. I've learned so much about myself, but never really had a place to express that. This website is the evolution of my voice over this time period. Some of the people I'm closest to actually know the least about me. I'm well aware that I've changed dramatically since high school, and that the longer you've known me, sometimes the harder it is to accept that. Whether you're disappointed, confused, excited, or optimistic about those changes, my hope is that those closest in my life would simply accept that this is me right now. Whatever image of me you were left with the last time we talked, I just hope you'd be able to put those connotations and expectations aside long enough for me to share who I've become.

			And if you're Nathaniel looking at this, I encourage you to reflect on why you made this website in the first place. Remember all the work you put into the code and graphics, and especially what it meant to you at the time. Reflect on how dark this period of your life was and the many things you did to try and resurrect yourself from that. Relive that escape into a world you could design with your own hands. If you're looking back at this one day, removed from the burdens of mental health, remind yourself that it wasn't the conventional gestures that got you where you are today. It wasn't about talking to a therapist and taking your meds, as important those things are. It was about staying up till 4am for 4 consecutive weeks on a personal project to distract yourself from your own malicious thoughts. It was about getting up when all you wanted to do was stay in bed and cuddle with your depression. Even if it was to sit in a desk chair to move keyframes on an animation for 18 hours straight, it was about doing something rather than nothing. It was about choosing to make a sappy cover of a breakup song instead of downing a bottle of scotch. It was about playing video games during your manic episodes rather than lying in bed crying about how difficult the insomnia was. It was about all the little things that added up to make living worth it again. This Nathaniel (the one writing to you now) may not think it is, but he's doing all this so that hopefully one day you get the chance to read this and say it came true.
